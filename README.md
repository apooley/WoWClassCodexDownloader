# ClassCodex Downloader

A simple downloader script for the [ClassCodex](https://addons.wago.io/addons/classcodex) Addon for World of Warcraft. (https://www.icy-veins.com/download)

The script downloads the latest production build of ClassCodex, verifies the downloaded files using SHA-256 checksums, and installs or updates the addon in your addons folder defined in the script folder.

## Features

* Downloads the latest ClassCodex production build
* Verifies the manifest using SHA-256
* Verifies every downloaded file using SHA-256
* Skips files that are already up to date
* Prevents unsafe manifest paths
* Uses temporary files during downloads to avoid incomplete files
* Supports a dry-run mode

## Requirements

* Python 3.9 or newer
* World of Warcraft game client

The script uses only Python's standard library, so no additional packages are required.

## Configuration

Open `classcodex_downloader.py` and set `ADDONS_PATH` to your World of Warcraft `AddOns` folder.

## Usage
Run the script from a terminal:
```bash
python classcodex_downloader.py
```

## Dry Run
If you want to see which files would be downloaded without modifying anything, set:
```python
DRY_RUN = True
```

The script will:
1. Download the current ClassCodex channel configuration.
2. Download and verify the manifest.
3. Verify that the manifest belongs to ClassCodex Retail.
4. Compare local files with the expected SHA-256 hashes.
5. Download missing or outdated files.
6. Verify every downloaded file.
7. Report the installed build and download results.



## Security
The downloader performs integrity checks before installing files.
The channel configuration provides the expected SHA-256 hash of the manifest. The manifest then provides the expected SHA-256 hash and file size for each addon file.
Downloaded files are verified before they are considered successfully installed.
The script also rejects manifest paths containing unsafe path traversal components.
